		<h1 class="text-center"> Homework 1 - Git, HTML/CSS and Bootstrap </h1>
		<p><a href="demos/hw1/index.html">Demo</a><br/><br/>
		This assignment was focused around the use of HTML, CSS and Bootstrap to 
		create a website about a subject of our choice. Our website is required to be hosted on 
		Github Pages and we edit and add to our website by using the command line version of Git.
		<br/></p>

		<h2> Part 1: Download Git and Setup Repository</h2>
		<p> Before beginning on the assignment proper, I had to first prepare a repository to store my content. 
		This involved downloading Git from <a href="https://git-scm.com/">git-scm.com</a>. After this, I created 
		a Github account as well as the repository and Github Pages website that come with it. I then cloned it 
		from Github to my computer to create my own local repository.
		<br/></p>
		
		<p id="code">git clone https://github.com/ahowar30/CS460<br/></p>
		
		<p>Then I configured git on my machine to include my name and email.<br/></p>
		
		<p id="code">git config --global user.name "Alex Howard" <br/>
		git config --global user.email "ahoward17@mail.wou.edu" <br/>
		</p>

		<p>And with that, I was setup and ready to work.<br/></p>
