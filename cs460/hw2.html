		<h2>Creating New Branch<br/><h2>
		<p>
		The objective of this assignment was to create a webpage that utilized Javascript and jQuery in order to take user input and 
		manipulate it to do something useful or interesting. Due to the prevalent use of zodiac signs to describe personality, I decided to explore 
		a similar idea that is much less known in the Western World: bloodtype personality. Whereas Zodiac signs determine personality based upon 
		a person's date of birth, bloodtype personality, as its name implies, determines personality based upon a person's bloodtype. There's no 
		scientific backing to either of these ideas, but they are in good fun. 
		<br/></p>
		
		<p>
		First I had to create a branch on my GitHub account on which I would work on my new webpage before later merging it back into the master.
