		<h2 class="text-center"> Greetings from the Paper Clamp Enthusiasts!</h2>
		<p>We are so glad that you have made your way to our webpage. We are 
		a community of individuals who have come to understand and respect 
		the elegance of the office supply commonly referred to as the paper clamp.<br/></p>
		
		<h2 class="text-center"> "Paper clamp? What's that?" </h2>
		<p> If you are new to the world of paper clamps, and possibly even the greater 
		community of general office supply aficionados, you are probably asking that 
		very question. The paper clamp is an office tool designed to hold loose pieces of 
		paper together so that they are easier to manage. Paper clamps are very useful
		in ensuring that related documents stay together and that no individual piece of 
		paper is lost.<br/></p>
		
		<h2 class="text-center"> "Oh, Like a Paper Clip?" </h2>
		<p> It is understandable why an untrained observer could see the paper clamp 
		as a tool reminiscent of a paper clip. It is true that their roles are very similar, 
		and oftentimes a casual user may employ both of them interchangably. However, that 
		is a gross misunderstanding of the nuances of both office supplies. First of all, 
		to imply that a paltry paper clip is in any way on the same level as a paper clamp 
		demonstrates the immense ignorance of whoever believes that. For one thing, Paper clips are
		dangerous. More paper clip related injuries happen every year than you may be aware of.
		They are sharp, and lack the smooth ends that are characteristic of paper clamps. 
   		Even disregarding that,a paper clamp is fundamentally different tool and should be employed as such.<br/></p>
		
		<h2 class="text-center"> "I'm Intrigued. How do I Join The Cause?" </h2>
		<p> We understand the enthusiasm. We really do. Please plan to attend the next meeting 
		of your local chapter for more details.<br/></p>
