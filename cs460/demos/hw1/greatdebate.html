	<h1 class="text-center"> The Great Debate </h1> 
	<p>From the outside, it may appear as if the community of paper clamps enthusiasts 
	are united, but in reality, there is a fundamental controversy plaguing the community.
	To this day, there is still no universally accepted name for what we call "paper clamps." Popular names include:
	</p>
	
	<dl>
		<li> Office Clips </li>
		<li> Desk Clamps </li>
		<li> Iron Fists of Order </li>
	</dl><br/>
	
	<p>However, the two most commonly argued ones are "paper clamps" and "binder clips."

					<h2> Paper Clamp Support</h2>
					<p> It's no secret that our organization tacitly supports the name of paper clamps. 
					Our name is evidence enough of that. However, we are far from the only ones who are
					in support. For one thing, the name is accurate. These tools are a form of clamps 
					used specifically for paper. It is self-evident. Although the name suffers from a lack 
					of common usage. Many casual users would not even recognize these tools by that name. <br/>

				<div class="col-md text-center">
					<h2> Binder Clip Support</h2>
					<p> Support for the name of binder clips has existed for many years. A large reason for this 
						is the word "clip" found within, which could be used to market these tools as competitors 
						within the same realm as paper clips. These office supplies have a lack of exposure in 
						comparison, so being able to tie itself to paper clip popularity and rise off of it could 
						be a good strategy for universial adoption of the tool. <br/>
